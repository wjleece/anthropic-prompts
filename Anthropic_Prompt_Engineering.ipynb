            "1. It prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment banking business.\n",
            "\n",

            "3. It created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure bank deposits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The main goal of the Glass-Steagall Act was to prevent the conflicts of interest that were seen as contributing to the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression. By separating commercial and investment banking, it was intended to reduce the risk of bank failures and protect consumers' deposits.\n",

            "The Glass-Steagall Act remained in place for over 60 years until it was largely repealed in 1999 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The repeal of Glass-Steagall was controversial, with some arguing it contributed to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.\n",
